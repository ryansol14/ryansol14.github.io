      This page will track your project and serve as your first major deliverable.
      It has two major components:
    </p>
    <ul style="max-width: 600px; margin: 1rem auto; font-weight: bold;">
      <li>Problem Statement</li>
      <li>Justification &amp; Synthesis</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="content-section" id="problem-statement">
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        This needs to be a separate webpage and will be tracking your project and be your first major deliverable.
        It has TWO major components now: Problem Statement and Justification Synthesis.

      <h2>Justification &amp; Synthesis</h2>
      <p>
        Construction job sites face multiple overlapping problems that affect safety, efficiency, and overall productivity.
        One of the most pressing concerns is worker health, particularly hydration. Surveys show that many construction workers
        experience dehydration during shifts, which can lead to headaches, dizziness, and even serious health risks. Without
        regular water access, concentration drops and mistakes increase, creating safety hazards. The Hoover Dam construction
        project is a historical example that demonstrates the consequences of inadequate hydration, as extreme heat and poor
        water access endangered thousands of workers and slowed progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inefficiency is another widespread problem. Studies reveal that the average construction worker spends about 38 hours
        each year simply searching for misplaced tools. Beyond this, companies lose valuable time and money when equipment is
        stolen or goes missing. Research shows that poor organization, unclear schedules, and wasted labor hours add up to
        significant project delays and higher costs. This lack of structure is compounded by the enormous amount of waste produced
        in construction. The EPA reports that construction and demolition debris make up a large portion of total U.S. waste,
        raising environmental and logistical issues. Effective site layout planning is critical, but many projects fail to prioritize
        it, resulting in job site chaos and inefficiencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safety is the most critical challenge. The construction industry consistently records some of the highest workplace
        fatality rates. Falls, slips, and trips remain the leading cause of deaths and injuries, with OSHA, BLS, and legal studies
        all pointing to inadequate prevention strategies as a core issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, dehydration, wasted time, lost tools, poor layout planning, excessive waste, and high accident rates underscore
        the urgent need for innovative solutions.
